Dr. Chris Yu, AnPac Bio’s Chairman and CEO commented: “We have accomplished a number of critical milestones in the first half of the year, including its successful listing on the NASDAQ Global Markets, the launch of two new products, such as our AnPac Defense Medical Examination immunology test. We have continued to work in obtaining the Class III medical device certification in China and laboratory developed test (LDT) designation in the US. We have improved our financial performance with increased revenue, gross margin and average selling price, and reduced our operating loss, with additional cost-cutting measures to take effect during the second half of the year. The above milestones were achieved despite the outbreak of COVID-19 in the period. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about further revenue growth and gross profit increases, and new test qualification and launches in the second half of the year and in future.”

Financial Results for the First Six Months of 2020

Revenue

Total revenues increased by 3.4% to RMB4.1 million (US$ 0.6 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB3.9 million for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to an increase in our ASP for the sales of cancer screening and detection tests.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues decreased by 3.5% to RMB2.2 million (US$0.3 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB 2.3 million for the first six months of 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the Company’s streamlining of various staffing functions and less staff costs following the Chinese government’s stimulus policies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in our cost of revenues was also attributable to a decrease in outsourced testing expenses, as we performed more tests in our own labs.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit increased by 13.1% to RMB1.8 million (US$0.3 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB1.6 million for the first six months of 2019. Gross margin was 45.3% for the first six months of 2020, an increase of 3.9 percentage points from 41.4% for the first six months of 2019.

Selling and Marketing Expenses

Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 24.0% to RMB4.7 million (US$0.7 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB6.1 million for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to less share-based compensation.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased by 64.4% to RMB7.4 million (US$1.1 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB4.5 million for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to increased research activities under one of our research projects.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by significantly to RMB50.7 million (US$7.2 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB24.0 million for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to higher professional service fees, which were primarily related to our IPO.

Interest Expenses

Interest expenses decreased by 59.7% to RMB517,000 (US$73,000) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB1,284,000 for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to our repayment of the short-term loans that were incurred prior to our IPO.

Other Income, Net

Net other income increased by significantly to RMB7.3 million (US$1.0 million) for the first six months of 2020 from RMB0.8 million for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to the reversal in fair value of the convertible loans that we borrowed from Zhijun after we repaid these loans.
