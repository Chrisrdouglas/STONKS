Antares Pharma Reports Strong Third Quarter 2020 Financial and Operating Results. Third Quarter 2020 Revenue Increases 17% Year-Over-Year to $40.0 Million

Third Quarter 2020 Net Income of $5.0 Million, or EPS of $0.03

EWING, N.J., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATRS) (“the Company”), a pharmaceutical technology company, today reported financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 with record revenue of $40.0 million and net income of $5.0 million, or earnings per share of $0.03. The Company also reported record nine-month year-to-date revenue of $105.5 million, a 23% increase versus the first nine months of 2019.

“We are excited to report another quarter of strong financial results that illustrate the significant growth across our diversified business of both proprietary and partner revenue. Our total revenue increased almost 17% year-over-year to $40.0 million, primarily driven by strong demand for XYOSTED and Teva’s generic Epipen. XYOSTED continues to represent our biggest growth driver, with 129% quarterly growth and 237% year-to-date growth in total prescriptions compared to the same periods in 2019. We believe the ongoing challenges for patients and physicians due to the pandemic will further support the increased demand for an easy-to-use, painless at-home testosterone replacement therapy. While we also remain committed to the development of our internal pipeline focused on urology and endocrinology, we are excited about the recent U.S. licensing of NOCDURNA which immediately expands our proprietary portfolio offering and leverages our existing salesforce given the significant overlap in urology call points,” said Robert F. Apple, President and Chief Executive Officer of Antares Pharma.

“Furthermore, we have a development pipeline with our partners that we believe are underappreciated opportunities. As generic teriparatide is launched in 11 European countries, Canada and Israel by Teva, we remain eager for the potential U.S approval. We also look forward to Idorsia initiating their Phase 3 trial for the selatogrel pen and being able to provide a timeline for the Pfizer program as we look ahead. Overall, we believe our diversified business will continue to advance and support our future aggressive growth,” Mr. Apple concluded.

Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Total revenue generated from product sales, license and development activities and royalties was $40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a 17% increase compared to $34.3 million in the same period in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total revenue was $105.5 million, a 23% increase from $86.0 million for the comparable period in 2019.

Product sales were $28.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a 17% increase compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2019. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, product sales were $80.7 million, a 27% increase from $63.6 million in the comparable period in 2019.

Sales of our proprietary products XYOSTED® and OTREXUP® generated revenue of $15.8 million and $43.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to $11.5 million and $25.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The 38% and 71% increase in proprietary product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were principally attributable to continued growth in prescriptions and sales of XYOSTED®.

Partnered product sales were $13.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and $37.5 million and $38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net decrease in sales of partnered products for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 is attributable to decreased sales of needle-free devices to Ferring, a decrease in sales of Makena® auto injectors to AMAG and a reduction in pre-launch quantities of generic teriparatide devices sold to Teva in previous periods. These decreases were offset by an increase in sales to Teva of their generic EpiPen auto-injectors.

Licensing and development revenue was $4.3 million and $8.8 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to $1.2 million and $4.4 million for the comparable periods in 2019, respectively. The increase in licensing and development revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily from the Pfizer rescue pen and the Idorsia selatogrel pen development programs.

Royalty revenue was $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2019. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, royalty revenue was $16.0 million, as compared to $18.1 million for the same period in 2019. The net decrease in royalty revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in royalties recognized from AMAG on their net sales of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injectors offset by an increase in royalties from Teva on their net sales of Epinephrine Injection USP.

Gross profit was $23.5 million and $21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $61.4 million and $49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in proprietary product sales.

Total operating expenses were $17.6 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $19.2 million in the comparable period of 2019. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $53.9 million as compared to $54.2 million for the comparable period in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the three and nine-month periods of 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales and marketing costs incurred as a result of the various stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions related to COVID-19.

Net income was $5.0 million, or $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share in the same period in 2019. Net income was $4.8 million, or $0.03 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a net loss of $6.7 million, or $0.04 loss per share in the comparable period of 2019.

As of September 30, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $52.2 million compared to $45.7 million as of December 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to cash used in operations of $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
