WATERTOWN, Mass., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: SELB), a biotechnology company leveraging its clinically validated ImmTOR™ platform to develop tolerogenic therapies that selectively mitigate unwanted immune responses, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 and provided corporate updates.

“This past quarter has been productive for our team as we have continued to progress our clinical programs,” said Carsten Brunn, Ph.D., President and CEO of Selecta. “We reported topline data from the Phase 2 COMPARE trial of SEL-212 which demonstrated the potential of our ImmTOR platform when combined with a highly immunogenic enzyme, and we commenced the Phase 3 DISSOLVE program in partnership with Sobi. We look forward to continuing to build our pipeline with our gene therapy programs in MMA and OTC deficiency, and our second enzyme program in IgA nephropathy. Our strategy is focused on leveraging ImmTOR to amplify the efficacy of biologic therapies and restore self-tolerance in autoimmune diseases.”

Recent Highlights and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones:

Two Key Clinical Milestones for SEL-212: In September, Selecta and Sobi commenced the Phase 3 clinical program, known as DISSOLVE, with Selecta running the program and Sobi reimbursing Selecta for costs associated with the program. The DISSOLVE clinical program consists of two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of SEL-212 ( NCT04513366 ) in which SEL-212 will be evaluated at two doses of ImmTOR (0.1 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg), and one dose of pegadricase (0.2 mg/kg) in both studies. Each trial will aim to enroll 105 patients (35 at each dose level and 35 on placebo). In DISSOLVE I, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at six months and will have a six-month extension. DISSOLVE II will assess safety and efficacy at only the six-month time point, with no extension. The primary endpoint in both studies is serum uric acid levels (SUA) less than 6 mg/dL at six months, a well-validated measure of disease severity in chronic refractory gout. Topline data from the DISSOLVE program is expected in the second half of 2022. Also in September, the Company reported topline results from the Phase 2 COMPARE clinical trial in which a once-monthly dose of SEL-212 (ImmTOR + pegadricase) was compared to biweekly doses of pegloticase. Sobi has in-licensed SEL-212 and assumes responsibility for all development (excluding DISSOLVE, which is run by Selecta and funded by Sobi), regulatory, and commercial activities, and expenses in all markets outside China. Selecta is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of up to $630 million, and tiered double-digit royalties on net sales.

Granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation with AskBio for Gene Therapy for Methylmalonic Acidemia: Selecta and AskBio have received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop MMA-101 in combination with ImmTOR for the treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) due to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) gene mutations. Selecta and AskBio expect to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in this program in the first half of 2021, with preliminary data expected by the end of 2021.

Entered into Research License and Option Agreement with IGAN Biosciences for the Use of ImmTOR in IgA Nephropathy: In October, Selecta and IGAN Biosciences reached an agreement which provides Selecta with the option to an exclusive license for the rights to develop and commercialize the ImmTOR platform in combination with IGAN’s immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Selecta intends to submit its Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for IgA nephropathy by the end of 2021. IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of galactose-deficient IgA1 immunoglobulin in the glomerular mesangium and is a leading contributor to development of chronic kidney disease and renal failure. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of IgAN.

Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results:

Cash Position: Selecta had $147.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020, which compares to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $91.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Selecta believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 will enable Selecta to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023.



• Net cash provided by operating activities was $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $38.6 million used for the same period in 2019.

Revenue: Revenue recognition for the third quarter 2020 was $4.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $4.3 million under the license agreement with Sobi resulting from the shipment of clinical supply and the reimbursement of costs incurred for the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program and $0.3 million for shipments under the collaboration agreement with Sarepta. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Selecta did not recognize revenue.

Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the third quarter 2020 were $14.0 million, which compares with $8.1 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in cost was primarily the result of the initiation of the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program. These costs are subject to the cost reimbursement arrangement under the license with Sobi. The increase in expense was also the result of the completion of its Phase 2 COMPARE trial for SEL-212 and for the AskBio Collaboration.

About Selecta Biosciences, Inc.

Selecta Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: SELB) is leveraging its clinically validated ImmTOR™ platform to develop tolerogenic therapies that selectively mitigate unwanted immune responses. With an observed ability to induce tolerance to highly immunogenic proteins, ImmTOR has the potential to amplify the efficacy of biologic therapies, including redosing of life-saving gene therapies, as well as restore the body’s natural self-tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The company’s first program aimed at addressing immunogenicity to AAV gene therapies is expected to enter clinical trials in early 2021 in collaboration with AskBio for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a rare metabolic disorder. A wholly-owned program focused on addressing IgA nephropathy driven by ImmTOR and a therapeutic enzyme is also in development among additional product candidates. Selecta recently licensed its Phase 3 clinical product candidate, SEL-212, in chronic refractory gout to Sobi. For more information, please visit www.selectabio.com .
