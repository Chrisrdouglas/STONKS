Auris Medical Provides Business Update and Reports First Half 2020 Financial Results. Advancing Phase 2 trial with AM-125 in acute vertigo based on positive interim data

Positive outcome from AM-201 trial in prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain

Addition of new intranasal program with development of drug-free spray for protection against airborne pathogens and allergens

Review of strategic options initiated

Hamilton, Bermuda, September 17, 2020 – Auris Medical Holding Ltd. (NASDAQ: EARS), a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing therapeutics that address important unmet medical needs in neurotology and central nervous system disorders, today provided a business update and announced financial results for the first half of the 2020 financial year ended June 30, 2020.

“Over the past few months we reached major milestones with our intranasal betahistine program, reporting positive safety and tolerability data as well as significant efficacy signals in two clinical trials,” stated Thomas Meyer, Auris Medical’s founder, Chairman and CEO. “The demonstration of a dose-dependent improvement in various vertigo measures provides further evidence for the therapeutic potential of AM-125 as a vestibular stimulant. Further, the reduction in antipsychotic-induced weight gain in our AM-201 trial suggests the potential of the drug in other therapeutic indications. In addition, we are now leveraging our experience with intranasal delivery into the development of a drug-free nasal spray for protection against airborne pathogens and allergens. We are very excited about this new program given the large number of people affected by allergic rhinitis and the strong need for personal protection against airborne pathogens, highlighted by the current Covid-19 pandemic.”

Development Program Updates

AM-125 for Treating Acute Vertigo

Reported positive results from interim analysis in Phase 2 trial with AM-125 in acute vertigo. On September 3, 2020 the Company announced top-line data from Part A of the TRAVERS trial, which enrolled 33 patients suffering from vertigo following neurosurgery. The patients were treated with AM-125 (intranasal betahistine) at 1, 10 or 20 mg or placebo (3 x daily) for four weeks. At the highest dose of 20 mg, AM-125-treated patients improved their performance of the “Tandem Romberg” and the “Standing on Foam” balance tests from baseline to 14 days post-surgery (primary endpoint) on average 1.9 to 2.4 times more than placebo-treated patients (6.0 vs. 3.1 and 10.5 vs. 4.3 seconds, respectively). In contrast to placebo, the improvement from baseline was statistically significant for AM-125 20 mg and for all active dose groups, respectively (p<0.02 and p<0.01 to p<0.05, respectively).

Selected doses and key endpoints for Part B of TRAVERS trial. Based on the results from the interim analysis, the two highest doses, 10 and 20 mg, were selected by the Company to be tested against placebo in 72 patients in Part B of the trial. The improvement in the “Standing on Foam” test two weeks post-surgery will be the sole primary efficacy endpoint, whereas the improvement in the “Tandem Romberg” test six weeks post-surgery will be the key secondary efficacy endpoint. Part B of the trial is expected to start shortly, as open label testing of oral betahistine for reference purposes will be completed (n=16).

AM-201 for Preventing Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain

Reported positive results from Phase 1b trial with AM-201 in antipsychotic-induced weight gain. On May 26, 2020, the Company reported top-line results from its Phase 1b trial in 80 healthy volunteers who were treated with oral olanzapine 10 mg and AM-201 (intranasal betahistine) at up to 30 mg or placebo 3x daily for four weeks. At the highest dose of 30 mg, the mean weight gain from baseline in AM-201-treated participants was 2.8 kg compared against 3.7 kg in control subjects; the primary efficacy endpoint of mean reduction in weight gain was 0.9 kg and statistically significant (p<0.02; n=81 with pre-specified Bayesian augmented controls). In a next step, following additional pre-clinical testing, the Company intends to file for an IND in 2021.

AM-301 for Protecting Against Airborne Pathogens and Allergens

Initiated development of a nasal spray for protection against airborne pathogens and allergens. On September 8, 2020 the Company announced that it had initiated under product code AM-301 the development of a drug-free nasal spray for personal protection against airborne pathogens and allergens. AM-301 is a gel which works by forming a protective layer on the nasal mucosa, acting as a physical barrier against airborne pathogens and allergens. In addition, the composition serves to “trap” such particles and help with their discharge. Together, this is designed to reduce the risk of infection and promote alleviation of allergic symptoms.

Demonstrated significant binding of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Testing the key component of AM-301 at various concentrations in a SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrated a reduction in the viral infectious load of up to 99%. The Company intends to perform additional testing involving various pathogens and allergens.

Corporate Developments

Set up new subsidiary dedicated to AM-301. The new subsidiary, Altamira Medica Ltd. (“Altamira”), is based in Zug, Switzerland, and has a share capital of CHF 0.5 mn. Currently owned 100% by Auris Medical Holding Ltd., ownership in Altamira is expected to decrease as other investors will be invited to join as shareholders once additional financing is required.

Raised CHF 1.5 million through a convertible loan. Under the agreement, Altamira obtained CHF 1.5 mn from FiveT Capital Holding Ltd., a Swiss investment management firm, to fund the development of AM-301. The loan has a term of 18 months, carries an interest rate of 8% p.a. and is convertible including accrued interest into common shares of either Altamira or Auris Medical Holding Ltd.

Initiated a review of strategic options. The Company’s Board of Directors has started a process to explore, review and evaluate a broad range of potential strategic alternatives. These alternatives include but are not limited to the partnering of its various clinical and preclinical programs, or a sale or merger of the Company, in an effort to unlock the potential of those assets and maximize shareholder value.

Regained compliance with Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On August 20, 2020, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that because the Company’s shares had a closing bid price at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days, the Company’s stock had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, and that the matter was closed.

Effected reduction in par value per share. As approved by the Company’s annual general meeting, the par value of each common share was reduced from CHF 0.40 to CHF 0.01, effective June 30, 2020. The transaction was cash neutral with the reduction in issued share capital being credited to the contributed surplus account.

First Half 2020 Financial Results

Total operating expenses for the first half of 2020 were CHF 2.4 million compared to CHF 4.1 million for the first half of 2019.

Research and development expenses for the first half of 2020 were CHF 0.9 million compared to CHF 1.3 million for the first half of 2019. 1

General and administrative expenses for the first half of 2020 were CHF 1.5 million compared to CHF 2.8 million for the first half of 2019.

Net loss for the first half of 2020 was CHF 2.7 million, or CHF 0.58 per share, compared to CHF 3.7 million, or CHF 1.66 per share, for the first half of 2019.

The Company expects its total cash needs in 2020, including project AM-301, to be in the range of CHF 7.0 to 8.5 million for expected total operating expenses of CHF 4.5 to 5.5 million and expected capitalized research and development expenses of CHF 2.5 to 3.0 million.
