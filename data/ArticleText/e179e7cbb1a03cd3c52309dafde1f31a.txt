Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Reports Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Provides Clinical Update. THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Oct. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX), today reported financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and provided an update of key milestones.



“In the third quarter, we streamlined our operations to prioritize our focus on our advancement of LX9211, a promising drug candidate with potential to become a treatment option for the millions of people living with neuropathic pain. Most people suffering with neuropathic pain experience only limited success with available therapies while enduring substantial side effects,” said Lonnel Coats, Lexicon’s president and chief executive officer. “We have commenced our first Phase 2 study in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and plan to commence our second Phase 2 study in post-herpetic neuralgia shortly with results for both studies expected by the end of next year.”

Third Quarter Highlights

LX9211

Commenced patient dosing in RELIEF-DPN-1, a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study of LX9211 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Enrollment is expected to total approximately 300 patients at 30 U.S. clinical sites.

Preparing to commence an additional Phase 2 study of LX9211 in post-herpetic neuralgia later this year.

Realignment and Debt Reduction

Realignment of the business around LX9211, sotagliflozin and other drug discovery and development programs.

Reduced outstanding debt by more than 90%, including the elimination of its $150 million secured term loan and $75.8 million principal amount of its 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021.

XERMELO® (telotristat ethyl)

XERMELO U.S. net sales were $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting sales during the quarter prior to the completion of the sale of XERMELO and related assets to TerSera Therapeutics LLC on September 8, 2020.

About LX9211

LX9211 is a potent, orally delivered, selective small molecule inhibitor of AAK1, a target with a pain phenotype discovered and extensively characterized in an alliance with Bristol Myers Squibb. Preclinical studies of LX9211 demonstrated central nervous system penetration and reduction in pain behavior in models of neuropathic pain without affecting opiate pathways. Lexicon holds exclusive research, development and commercialization rights to LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1 under the alliance.

About Sotagliflozin

Discovered using Lexicon’s unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is an oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney. Sotagliflozin is approved in the European Union (EU) for use as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve blood sugar (glycemic) control in adults with type 1 diabetes with a body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2, who could not achieve adequate glycemic control despite optimal insulin therapy, but has not yet been commercially launched.
