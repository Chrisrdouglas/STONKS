Harvard Bioscience Announces Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results. Operating margin up year-over-year on GAAP and adjusted basis

Revenue improved sequentially with solid CRO/pharma demand and academic labs reopening

Generated positive operating cash flow in Q3 with working capital improvements



HOLLISTON, Mass., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harvard Bioscience, Inc. (Nasdaq: HBIO) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Jim Green, Chairman and CEO said, “Since anticipating academic labs around the world would likely experience pandemic-related shutdowns early in the year, we moved aggressively to manage costs. These actions, combined with restructuring programs, reduced overall cost of operations delivering year-over-year adjusted operating income and margin growth.”

Green concluded, “The continued growth from CRO/pharma customers, reopening of academic labs and our lower cost of operations, are expected to drive solid operating margins throughout the rest of 2020 and allow for targeted commercial and product investments to drive revenue growth. We expect adjusted operating margins for the second half of 2020 to be in the mid to upper teens.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

In this press release, we have included non-GAAP financial information including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with an enhanced understanding of the underlying operations of the business. For the periods presented, these non-GAAP financial measures have excluded certain expenses and income primarily resulting from purchase accounting or events that we do not believe are related to the underlying operations of the business such as amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, costs related to acquisition, disposition and integration initiatives, impairment charges, severance, restructuring and other business transformation expenses, and stock-based compensation expense. They also exclude the tax impact of the reconciling items. This non-GAAP financial information approximates information used by our management to internally evaluate the operating results of the Company. Tabular reconciliations of our adjusted operating income, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share are included as exhibits below in this press release.

The non-GAAP financial information provided in this press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the financial information provided and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different than other companies’ non-GAAP financial information.
