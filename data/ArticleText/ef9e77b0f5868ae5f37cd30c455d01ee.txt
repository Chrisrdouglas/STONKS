MediWound Completes Enrollment Stage of its NexoBrid Phase 3 Pediatric Study. YAVNE, Israel, Oct. 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediWound Ltd. (Nasdaq: MDWD), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company bringing innovative therapies to address unmet needs in severe burn and wound management, today announced it has completed the enrollment stage of its NexoBrid® Phase 3 pediatric clinical study (CIDS - Children Innovation Debridement Study). Top-line results with 12 months follow up data anticipated during the second half of 2021. Additionally, the completion of the CIDS enrollment stage follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s recent agreement to allow the NexoBrid expanded access (NEXT) protocol to be expanded to include pediatric as well as adult burn patients.



“We are pleased to complete the enrollment stage of our NexoBrid pediatric Phase 3 study, which is one of the most comprehensive randomized controlled studies ever conducted in pediatric burn patients,” said Sharon Malka, Chief Executive Officer of MediWound. “The current mode of pediatric burn management requires intensive medical therapy, which poses challenges due to the surgical complexities in treating young patients with severe burns. Having NexoBrid as a non-surgical option, provides a minimally invasive alternative to the current surgical standard of care for treating severe burns in pediatric patients. We look forward to generating top-line results while we expand enrollment in our ongoing NEXT protocol to also include pediatric patients.”

Nick Colangelo, President and CEO of Vericel added, “Completing the enrollment stage of the CIDS study is an important step toward our goal of providing NexoBrid as a treatment option for pediatric patients with severe burns given NexoBrid’s potential to address the unique challenges in treating children with severe burns.”

CIDS is a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, prospective, controlled, assessor-blinded study with 145 patients aged 0-18 years, randomized to be treated with either NexoBrid or standard-of-care, with follow-up periods at 12 months and at 24 months. The study’s objectives are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NexoBrid compared with the standard-of-care in hospitalized children with severe thermal burns of 1 percent to 30 percent Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). The study is being conducted primarily in the U.S. and Europe in accordance with a design and study protocol endorsed by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. FDA. The study design includes two stages of data analysis – upon 12-month data collection, anticipated in the second half of 2021, and upon 24-month data collection, anticipated in the second half of 2022. The study is fully funded by the Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The ongoing NEXT protocol, which is supported and funded by BARDA, enables the continued clinical use of NexoBrid for U.S. patients during the review of the NexoBrid Biologics License Application (BLA). NEXT is an open-label, single-arm treatment protocol which allows for the treatment of up to 150 burn patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns up to 30 percent of total body surface area. NEXT has been designed to be consistent with current real-life burn treatment practices in the U.S. and up to 30 U.S. burn centers are anticipated to participate.

The inclusion of pediatric patients in the NEXT protocol will allow additional physicians to expand their experience with NexoBrid in pediatric patients, ensure burn care preparedness, and expand the national capacity of trained physicians available to treat patients with NexoBrid in a non-declared emergency until the potential approval of the product for pediatric use in the U.S.

About NexoBrid

NexoBrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in Bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue. NexoBrid is approved in the European Union and other international markets and has been designated as an orphan biologic drug in the United States, European Union, and other international markets. Vericel holds an exclusive license for North American commercial rights to NexoBrid. In January 2019, MediWound announced positive top-line results from the acute phase of the pivotal Phase 3 U.S. clinical study (DETECT) of NexoBrid in adult patients with deep partial-and full-thickness thermal burns up to 30 percent of total body surface area. The study met its primary endpoint of complete eschar removal compared to gel vehicle as well as all secondary endpoints compared to standard of care (SOC), including shorter time to eschar removal, a lower incidence of surgical eschar removal and lower blood loss during eschar removal. Safety endpoints, including the key safety endpoint of non-inferiority in time to complete wound closure compared with patients treated with SOC, were also achieved. In addition, the twelve-month follow-up safety data of cosmesis and function were found to be comparable between the treatment and SOC arms, and no new safety signals were observed. On September 16, 2020, the FDA accepted for review the NexoBrid BLA for eschar removal (debridement) in adults with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness thermal burns and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of June 29, 2021. Additional twenty-four-month long term safety follow up data will be submitted as a safety labeling update as part of a post-approval commitment. NexoBrid is currently an investigational product in the United States.

About MediWound Ltd.

MediWound is a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing novel therapeutics based on its patented proteolytic enzyme technology to address unmet needs in the fields of severe burns, chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds. MediWound’s first innovative biopharmaceutical product, NexoBrid, non-surgically and rapidly removes burn eschar without harming viable tissue. The product has received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency as well as the Israeli, Argentinian, South Korean, Russian and Peruvian Ministries of Health for eschar removal (debridement) in adults with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness thermal burns. On June 29, 2020, a biological license application (BLA) was submitted to the U.S. FDA. MediWound’s second innovative product, EscharEx® is a topical biological drug candidate for the debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds using the same proteolytic enzyme technology as NexoBrid. In two Phase 2 studies, EscharEx has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the debridement of various chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds, within a few daily applications.
