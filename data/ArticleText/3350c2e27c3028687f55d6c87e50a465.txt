vTv Therapeutics to Present Additional Positive Clinical Study Results from Phase 2 Simplici-T1 Study of TTP399 as Adjunctive Therapy for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes at EASD Virtual Meeting. HIGH POINT, N.C., Sept. 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- vTv Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: VTVT) today announced it will deliver two oral presentations emphasizing the potential of TTP399 as an oral adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes at the 56th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, held virtually September 21-25, 2020.



In June 2020 at the American Diabetes Association’s 80th Virtual Scientific Sessions, the Company presented positive clinical data from the Phase 2 Simplici-T1 Study confirming that treatment with TTP399 resulted in significant improvements in HbA1c, with reduction in bolus insulin dose, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Details of the EASD virtual presentations follow:

Oral Presentation Title: “The Simplici-T1 Trial: Activation of Glucokinase by TTP399 Improves Glycaemic Control in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes”

Presentation Number: 50

Category: OP 09 Novel Agents in Type 1 Diabetes

Date and Time: Tuesday, September 22, 2020, 8:45 AM - 9:00 AM ET

Oral Presentation Title: “Mechanism Matter: Preliminary Evidence That Activation of Glucokinase by TTP399 Does Not Increase Plasma or Urine Ketones in Type 1 Diabetes”

Presentation Number: 51

Category: OP 09 Novel Agents in Type 1 Diabetes

Date and Time: Tuesday, September 22, 2020, 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM ET

About the Simplici-T1 Study

Simplici-T1 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, adaptive study assessing the safety and efficacy of TTP399 as an adjunct to insulin therapy in adults with T1D. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c at week 12. The study was conducted with support from JDRF, the leading global organization funding research in type 1 diabetes.

This Phase 2 learn-and-confirm study was conducted in two parts under a treat-to-target protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TTP399 in T1D patients over 12 weeks of daily dosing following a multi-week insulin optimization and placebo run-in period. Part 1 enrolled 19 patients on both insulin pumps and CGMs. The positive topline results from the learning phase - Part 1 were reported in June 2019. The confirming phase, Part 2, enrolled 85 patients that used either insulin pumps or multiple daily injections of insulin; CGMs were allowed for those patients using the devices for at least three months prior to the start of the study.

About Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which a person’s pancreas stops producing insulin, a hormone that enables people to get energy from food. It occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, called beta cells. While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. Its onset has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle. There is nothing you can do to prevent T1D, and—at present—nothing you can do to cure it.
