Financial results for third quarter 2020

Cash and equivalents at September 30, 2020 totaled $177.7 million, compared with $212.0 million at June 30, 2020.

Net total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were $42.7 million, net of grant income of $0.4 million and license revenue of $0.2 million, as compared to net operating expenses of $35.6 million, net of grant income of $0.3 million, for the same period in 2019.

Research and development expenses increased to $33.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from $27.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Cash costs, which exclude depreciation and amortization as well as share-based compensation, increased to $30.0 million from $21.6 million. The increase in research and development cash costs of $8.4 million consisted primarily of (i) an increase in compensation and employment related costs, net of lower travel costs as a result of the ongoing pandemic, of $1.5 million due to an increase in employee headcount to support the advancement of our product candidates in clinical development, (ii) an increase of $3.6 million in project expenses as a consequence of the advancement of our clinical portfolio which includes research and process development and manufacturing activities necessary to prepare, activate, and monitor clinical trial programs, (iii) an increase of $2.1 million in facilities costs related to the commencement of a lease for a manufacturing facility and the continued scaling of manufacturing operations, (iv) an increase of $1.4 million in IT infrastructure and support for information systems related to the conduct of clinical trials, (v) an increase of $0.8 million related to cell logistics and (vi) an increase of $0.4 million in legal and professional fees, which is offset by decreases in materials purchases of $1.3 million.

Non-cash costs decreased to $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease is primarily related to share-based compensation expense included in research and development expenses, which decreased by $2.5 million as a result of a lower fair value of stock options recognized in the period, offset by a $0.3 million increase in depreciation.

General and administrative expenses increased to $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Cash costs, which exclude depreciation expense as well as share-based expense compensation, increased to $7.7 million from $5.6 million. There was an increase of (i) $1.0 million in commercial activities, (ii) an increase of $0.7 million in patent legal fees, audit fees, and costs incurred as a result of being a public company, and (iii) an increase of $0.3 million in compensation and employment related costs due to an increase in headcount, net of lower travel costs.

Non-cash costs decreased to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease is attributed to share-based compensation expense as a result of the lower fair value of stock options recognized during the period.

Interest income decreased by $0.5 million for three months ended September 30, 2020 due to lower interest rates for cash held on deposit.

Other (expense)/ income decreased by $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from other income of $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 to other expense of $2.5 million primarily due to a decrease of $7.1 million with regard to weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to the pound sterling during the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, offset by lease termination gains of $1.3 million.

Income tax benefit increased to $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 due to increased research and development credits. As research and development credits grew at a faster rate than our net loss before income tax, this led to a higher effective tax rate. Research and development credits are obtained at a maximum rate of 33.35% of our qualifying research and development expenses, and the increase in the net credit was primarily attributable to an increase in our eligible research and development expenses.

Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $27.2 million for the same period in 2019.



The basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $(0.72), compared to a basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share of $(0.61) for the three months ended September 30, 2019.

The Company anticipates that cash on hand is sufficient to fund operations into 2022.
