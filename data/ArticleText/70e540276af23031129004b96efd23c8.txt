BOSTON, Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: XFOR), a leader in the discovery and development of novel therapies targeting diseases resulting from dysfunction of the CXCR4 pathway, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. The company also provided an update on its lead investigational candidate, mavorixafor, a novel small molecule in a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome and in two Phase 1b trials in patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia and Severe Congenital Neutropenia (SCN), respectively.

“The third quarter was highlighted by the publication of our positive Phase 2 safety and efficacy data for mavorixafor in WHIM syndrome in the prestigious journal, Blood, which, we believe, continues to demonstrate the significant potential of our lead candidate to treat this patient population,” said Paula Ragan, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of X4 Pharmaceuticals. “Further, in early October, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted mavorixafor Fast Track Designation for the treatment of WHIM, facilitating expedited review of mavorixafor as we proceed through clinical development. Both achievements enhance our confidence in mavorixafor’s potential to deliver the first disease-modifying therapy for this undertreated patient population. We were also thrilled to enhance our leadership team and expertise through the additions of Art Taveras, Ph.D., as Chief Scientific Officer and new board member, Alison Lawton.”

Dr. Ragan continued, “While the operating environment remains challenging due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to advance our mavorixafor development programs and enroll patients into our clinical trials. We anticipate initial data from our Phase 1b Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia trial in the first half of 2021, along with initial data from our Phase 1b trial in patients with SCN in 2021, and top-line results from our Phase 3 trial of mavorixafor in WHIM syndrome in 2022. As we continue to achieve important clinical progress,” Dr. Ragan concluded, “we are supported by a strong balance sheet that we expect will drive our current strategic and development plans into early 2022.”

Recent Highlights

Published comprehensive data from the Phase 2 and open label extension study of mavorixafor in WHIM syndrome in Blood , the official journal of the American Society of Hematology, expanding on previously presented data. New results included long-term patient-level data regarding the effect on neutrophils and lymphocytes and the effect of increasing doses of mavorixafor on total white blood cell counts and monocytes. In addition, the manuscript provided the most up-to-date pharmacokinetic data and presented a detailed analysis of the clinical improvements in infection rates and warts demonstrated with extended mavorixafor treatment.

Granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for mavorixafor in WHIM syndrome. Through the Fast Track program, X4 will be eligible for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss mavorixafor’s development plan, protocols and clinical data that would support its potential approval for WHIM. Mavorixafor was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, as well as Orphan Drug status by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of WHIM syndrome

About X4 Pharmaceuticals

X4 Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company and a leader in the discovery and development of novel therapies for the treatment of diseases resulting from dysfunction of the CXCR4 pathway, with a focus on rare diseases and those with limited treatment options. The Company’s lead candidate, mavorixafor, is a first-in-class, small molecule antagonist of chemokine receptor CXCR4 being developed as a once-daily oral therapy. X4 believes that inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor creates the potential for mavorixafor to provide therapeutic benefit across a wide variety of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and certain types of cancer. The efficacy and safety of mavorixafor, dosed once daily, is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with WHIM syndrome, and in two Phase 1b clinical trials – in combination with ibrutinib in patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and as monotherapy in patients with Severe Congenital Neutropenia. X4 is continuing to leverage its insights into CXCR4 biology at its corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts and at its research facility in Vienna, Austria, and is discovering and developing additional product candidates.
