About KOMET-001

KOMET-001 (Kura Oncology Menin Inhibitor Trial) is a Phase 1/2A study to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose of KO-539 in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A planned expansion phase in specific genetic subgroups, including NPM1 mutant AML and KMT2A rearranged AML, is expected to further evaluate anti-leukemic activity and tolerability of KO-539. Additional information about the Phase 1/2A study of KO-539 can be found at kuraoncology.com/clinical-trials-komet.
