Financial Guidance for 2020

Our financial guidance for the fiscal year 2020 is based on expectations for our existing business and includes the financial impact of our acquisitions of C Technologies (which closed on May 31, 2019), Engineered Molding Technology (which closed on July 13, 2020) and Non-Metallic Solutions, Inc. (which closed on October 20, 2020). The guidance below does not include the impact of our proposed acquisition of ARTeSYN Biosolutions, which is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2020. The guidance also excludes the impact of potential additional acquisitions and future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

FISCAL YEAR 2020 GUIDANCE:

Total revenue is projected to be in the range of $348-$352 million, an increase from our previous guidance of $332-$340 million. This updated revenue guidance includes approximately $1 million in projected revenue from Non-Metallic Solutions, and reflects overall revenue growth of 29%-30%, with organic revenue growth in the range of 23%-24%.





COVID programs are expected to account for approximately 10% of revenue.





Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 57.5%-58.0% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, compared to our previous guidance of 56.5%-57%.

Income from operations is expected to be in the range of $66-$68 million on a GAAP basis, an increase from our previous guidance of $59-$62 million. Adjusted income from operations (non-GAAP) is expected to be in the range of $91-$93 million, an increase from our previous guidance of $81-$84 million.





Net income is expected to be in the range of $47.5-$49.5 million on a GAAP basis, an increase from our previous guidance of $41-$44 million. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) is expected to be in the range of $75-$77 million, an increase from our previous guidance of $66-$69 million. Our current guidance reflects an adjusted tax rate of 17% on adjusted pre-tax income, compared to our previous guidance of 18%.





Fully diluted EPS (GAAP) is expected to be in the range of $0.89-$0.93, an increase from our previous guidance of $0.77-$0.82. Adjusted fully diluted EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to be in the range of $1.41-$1.45, an increase from our previous guidance of $1.24-$1.29.



Our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal year 2020 excludes the following items:

$9.2 million estimated acquisition and integration expenses; $0.5 million in cost of product revenue, $0.5 million in R&D and $8.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”).





Expected inventory step-up charges of $0.2 million related to the acquisitions of Engineered Molding Technology and Non-Metallic Solutions.





$15.8 million estimated intangible amortization expense; $0.3 million in cost of product revenue and $15.6 million in SG&A.





$11.0 million of non-cash interest expense (Other income (expense)) related to our convertible debt notes.



Our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal year 2020 includes:

An income tax expense of $8.6 million, representing the tax impact of acquisition and integration, inventory step-up, and intangible amortization expenses, as well as non-cash interest expenses related to our convertible debt notes.



All reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) guidance are detailed in the tables included later in this press release.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

To supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: revenue growth rate at constant currency, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS), adjusted cost of sales, adjusted research & development expense, adjusted SG&A, adjusted income tax expense and adjusted income tax rate. The Company provides organic revenue growth rates in constant currency to exclude the impact of both foreign currency translation, and the impact of acquisition revenue for current year periods that have no prior year comparable, in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. The Company provides revenue growth rates in constant currency in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate revenue growth rates in constant currency, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.

The Company’s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: acquisition and integration costs, inventory step-up charges and intangible amortization costs related to the Company’s acquisitions, as well as non-cash interest expenses related to the Company’s convertible debt, and the related impact on tax of non-GAAP charges. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.

A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) financial measures, as well as EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, is included as an attachment to this press release. When analyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutable for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
