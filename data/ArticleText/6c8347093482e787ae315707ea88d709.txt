New prescriptions of XHANCE increased 23% from second quarter 2020

Conference call and webcast to be held today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time

YARDLEY, Pa., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Optinose (NASDAQ:OPTN), a pharmaceutical company focused on patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and provided operational updates.

“New and total prescriptions for XHANCE reached an all-time quarterly high in the third quarter of 2020. We are pleased with this achievement after experiencing a challenging environment in the second quarter 2020 due to significant pandemic-related declines in patient volume in ENT and Allergy offices,” stated CEO Peter Miller. “As a result of increased demand and improvement in net revenue per prescription, XHANCE net revenues were $15.4 million. By exceeding the third quarter 2020 net revenue threshold specified in our debt facility, we open up the option to draw an additional $20 million to add to our cash position, which would extend our cash runway and further enable us to focus on growth. Finally, we are excited by recent events that we believe meaningfully support XHANCE growth potential as we progress into 2021. These include both our co-promotion with kaléo, which first hit the field in October and grows our sales reach and frequency, and the new publication by Brent Senior, M.D., Professor of Otolaryngology and Vice Chair of Academics and Outreach at the University of North Carolina, and others that describes the value of XHANCE in the population of patients who are still symptomatic on conventional nasal steroids.”

Third Quarter 2020 and Recent Highlights

Total and New XHANCE Prescriptions

The number of XHANCE® (fluticasone propionate) prescriptions increased by 61% from 43,000 in the third quarter of 2019 to 69,000 in the third quarter of 2020.

The number of new prescriptions for XHANCE increased by 23% from 18,700 in the second quarter of 2020 to 23,000 in the third quarter of 2020.

Kaléo Co-Promotion Agreement

In July the Company announced the signing of an agreement with kaléo, a pharmaceutical company dedicated to building innovative solutions for serious and life-threatening medical conditions, to co-promote XHANCE. Under the terms of the agreement, kaléo initiated promotion of XHANCE to an agreed-upon audience of office-based healthcare professionals on October 1st. The audience includes nearly 6,000 prescribers, about half of whom are outside of the current Optinose called-on universe of approximately 10,000 healthcare professionals.

Peer-Reviewed Scientific Journal Publications

In September the Company announced the publication of a peer-reviewed paper titled, “Efficacy of the exhalation delivery system with fluticasone (EDS-FLU) in patients who remain symptomatic on standard nasal steroid sprays”1 in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the journal of the American Rhinologic Society. EDS-FLU is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older and is marketed under the trade name XHANCE for the up to 1 in 3 patients whose chronic rhinosinusitis is complicated by nasal polyps.

OPN-019

In June, the Company announced the initiation of development of a new product candidate, OPN-019. OPN-019 will combine the Company’s proprietary nasal Exhalation Delivery System (EDS) with an antiseptic that has been shown in third party in vitro studies to kill the virus that causes COVID-19.

The Company has performed in vitro testing against SARS-CoV-2 with a candidate antiseptic formulation in which a 4-log reduction (a 99.99% reduction) in virus count was produced. In addition, the Company is performing tests against other pathogens and expects results in November.

Because components of the drug-device combination product candidate, including both the active drug and delivery device, are currently commercially available in the U.S., the Company anticipates streamlined and accelerated development. Subsequent to a pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) submission the Company is engaged with FDA regarding an IND and clinical development pathway.

The Company is focused on supporting the initial stages of development within its current operating expense guidance and intends to seek grants, partnerships, and/or other sources of capital to fund future development.
