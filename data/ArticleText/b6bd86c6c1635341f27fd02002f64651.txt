WATERTOWN, Mass., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYPT), a pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 and highlighted recent corporate developments.

“With the continued increase in patient office visits and resumption of operations at many healthcare facilities during the quarter, we were encouraged to see customer demand for both YUTIQ® and DEXYCU® near pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels,” said Nancy Lurker, President and Chief Executive Officer of EyePoint Pharmaceuticals. “We enter the remaining months of 2020 with the EyePoint and ImprimisRx combined sales teams mobilized to promote DEXYCU to their established account base and our YUTIQ team continuing to call on uveitis and retinal physician offices, subject to evolving COVID-19-related restrictions.”

Ms. Lurker continued, “With the recent completion of our good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology study of EYP-1901, a potential six-month sustained delivery intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), we remain on track to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application before the end of the year. Upon acceptance of the IND by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we look forward to initiating a Phase 1 trial of EYP-1901 in wet AMD, a sight-threatening eye disease that is in significant need of longer-lasting treatment options that may slow its progression. In addition, we continue to diligently manage our cash and burn rate and ended October 31, 2020 with $30.5 million in cash.”

Commercial Performance in Third Quarter 2020

Customer demand for YUTIQ, represented as units purchased by physicians from the Company’s distributors, was approximately 450 units in Q3 2020 as compared to approximately 430 units in Q2 2020.

Customer demand for DEXYCU, represented as units purchased by ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) from the Company’s distributors, was approximately 4,700 units in Q3 2020 as compared to approximately 2,100 units in Q2 2020.

Separate purchasing and marketing agreements for expanded access to DEXYCU across the U.S. were recently executed with Vantage Outsourcing and another undisclosed healthcare network. The Company is actively negotiating agreements with additional group purchasing organizations and networks.

In August, the Company and ImprimisRx signed a commercial alliance for the joint promotion of DEXYCU in the U.S. which more than doubles the size of our team engaging directly with physicians and ASCs. During September, ImprimisRx’s sales specialists and inside sales team completed product training and are positioned to call on their ophthalmologist, hospital and ASC accounts.

The Company continues to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health recommendations to ensure the safety of our patients, physicians and employees.



Operations Update

In October, based in part on the return in customer demand for both products following COVID-19-related closures, the Company secured an amendment to its existing debt facility with CRG Servicing LLC (CRG) in which CRG waived the covenant associated with the Company’s net product revenue for DEXYCU and YUTIQ for the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2020. CRG also agreed to a reduction of the calendar year 2021 net product revenue covenant to $45 million from $80 million. There were no other material changes made to the term loan agreement and the Company incurred no incremental charges in connection with the amendment.

In August, the Company and Ocumension Therapeutics announced an expansion of their exclusive license agreements for YUTIQ and DEXYCU in certain markets in Asia. Under the expanded agreements, Ocumension made a one-time $9.5 million payment to EyePoint for rights to commercialize both products under its own brand names in South Korea and other jurisdictions across Southeast Asia and as the full and final payment of all remaining development, regulatory, and commercial sale milestone payments under the original license agreements. Royalties for future product sales remain payable to the Company pursuant to the license agreements.

R&D Highlights

In October, the Company completed a GLP toxicology study for EYP-1901, a potential six-month sustained delivery intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment using its bioerodible Durasert® technology for wet AMD. The Company expects to file an IND application with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2020 with a Phase 1 human clinical trial to commence shortly after IND acceptance by the FDA.



Review of Results for Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2020

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, total net revenue was $15.7 million compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Net product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $5.8 million, with $3.5 million for YUTIQ and $2.3 million for DEXYCU, compared to net product revenue for three months ended September 30, 2019 of $1.0 million generated primarily by DEXYCU. Net product revenue represents product purchased by EyePoint’s distributors whereas customer demand represents purchases of product by physician practices and ASCs from EyePoint’s distributors.

Net revenue from licenses, royalties and collaborations for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $9.9 million compared to $1.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2019.

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $17.7 million compared to $16.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was driven by a $1.6 million increase in cost of sales, a $1.4 million increase in G&A expense and $0.6 million increase in R&D expense being offset by a $2.5 million reduction in sales and marketing expense. Non-operating expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $1.8 million of net interest expense. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $3.8 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $15.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the prior year quarter.

Review of Nine Months Results Ended September 30, 2020

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total net revenue was $27.3 million compared to $11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $14.2 million, compared to net product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $8.9 million.

Net revenue from royalties and collaborations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $13.2 million compared to $2.8 million in the corresponding period in 2019.

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $51.9 million from $50.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in cost of sales, a $1.0 million increase in R&D expense and a $1.2 million increase in G&A expense offset by a $2.9 million decrease in sales and marketing expense. Non-operating expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 totaled $5.4 million. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $29.9 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to a net loss of $46.4 million, or $0.45 per share, for the prior year period.

Cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2020 totaled $30.5 million compared to $28.7 million at September 30, 2020 and $22.2 million at December 31, 2019.

Financial Outlook

We expect that the Company’s cash and cash equivalents combined with projected cash inflows from anticipated YUTIQ and DEXYCU product sales and other expected financing activities can fund the Company’s operating plan into 2021 assuming no significant increase in COVID-19-related closures that would materially affect the frequency of ophthalmology office visits or the number of cataract surgical procedures performed across the U.S.

The Company continues to assess additional cash conservation and generation measures to support its operations through the COVID-19 pandemic.
