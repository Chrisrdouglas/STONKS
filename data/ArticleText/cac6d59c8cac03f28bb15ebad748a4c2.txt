Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Total revenue in the third quarter 2020 was $67.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 38% from total revenue of $48.8 million in the third quarter of 2019. On a constant currency basis, third quarter 2020 total revenue was $65.7 million, representing operational revenue growth measured at constant currency exchange rates of 35%. Reported revenue was aided by a positive currency impact of $1.7 million, or 3%.

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $509.1 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $452.7 million at December 31, 2019.

Total GAAP operating expenses of $111.8 million for the third quarter 2020 increased as compared to $100.5 million for the third quarter 2019, reflecting continued investments in our pipeline offset by decreased travel and third-party costs.

Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $92.4 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased as compared to $89.7 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting continued investments in our pipeline offset by decreased travel and third-party costs. 1

Net loss was $64.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $61.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the third quarter 2019. The third quarter 2020 net loss included an impact of $7.3 million relating to extinguishment of debt.

1 Full reconciliation of GAAP results to the Company’s non-GAAP adjusted measures for all reporting periods appear in the tables to this press release.

2020 Financial Guidance

For the full-year 2020, the Company anticipates total Galafold revenue of $250 million to $260 million based on the average exchange rates for 2019.

Non-GAAP operating expense guidance for the full-year 2020 is $410 million to $420 million, driven by continued investment in the global Galafold launch, AT-GAA clinical studies, and advancing our gene therapy pipeline. 2

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $509.1 million at September 30, 2020. Based on current operating models, the Company believes that the current cash position, along with the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Secured Term Loan, and expected future revenues are sufficient to fund the Company’s operations and ongoing research programs through to self-sustainability.

2 A reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort due to high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure.

About Galafold

Galafold® (migalastat) 123 mg capsules is an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants. In these patients, Galafold works by stabilizing the body’s own dysfunctional enzyme so that it can clear the accumulation of disease substrate. Globally, Amicus Therapeutics estimates that approximately 35 to 50 percent of Fabry patients may have amenable GLA variants, though amenability rates within this range vary by geography. Galafold is approved in over 40 countries around the world, including the U.S., EU, U.K., Japan and others.

U.S. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Galafold is indicated for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) variant based on in vitro assay data.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in kidney interstitial capillary cell globotriaosylceramide (KIC GL-3) substrate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release also contains adjusted financial measures that we believe provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information. These adjusted financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We typically exclude certain GAAP items that management does not believe affect our basic operations and that do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Other companies may define these measures in different ways. Full reconciliations of GAAP results to the comparable non-GAAP measures for the reported periods appear in the financial tables section of this press release. When we provide our expectation for non-GAAP operating expenses on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains or losses. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.
