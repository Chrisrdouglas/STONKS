Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Revenue from product sales of Strimvelis were $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $1.9 million in the same period in 2019, and cost of product sales were $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.6 million in the same period in 2019.

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $14.7 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $28.5 million in the same period in 2019. R&D expenses include the costs of clinical trials and preclinical work on the company’s portfolio of investigational gene therapies, as well as costs related to regulatory, manufacturing, license fees and milestone payments under the company’s agreements with third parties, and personnel costs to support these activities. The decline in R&D expenses is primarily attributable to the company’s U.K. research and development tax credits, which are recorded as an offset to R&D expense. During the third quarter of 2020, the company recorded tax credits of $10.1 million as compared to $2.7 million in the same period in 2019. Further, the company has realized savings associated with an updated strategy and corporate restructuring previously announced in May 2020, including the consolidation of its R&D sites.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $14.2 million in the same period in 2019. The decline was primarily due to lower administrative and corporate expenses as compared to the prior period, primarily resulting from the May 2020 corporate restructuring.

Net loss was $20.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $36.7 million in the same period in 2019. The lower net loss compared to the same period in 2019 is a result of the higher U.K. research and development tax credits, the savings associated with an updated strategic plan and corporate restructuring, and $5.5 million in other income primarily attributable to unrealized foreign currency gains in the quarter. The company had 97.7 million ordinary shares outstanding as of September 30, 2020.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2020, were $201.3 million compared to $325.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by cash used to fund operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the company received approximately $13.6 million of cash from R&D tax credits related to 2018 as a result of qualifying activities under the tax code in the U.K. The company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will fund its anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements into 2022. This excludes the $50 million expected to be available under the company’s credit facility and any non-dilutive capital received from potential future partnerships or priority review vouchers.

“Our European commercial team is in place and have executed the activities necessary to launch Libmeldy (if approved) on a country-by-country basis in the first half of 2021,” said Frank Thomas, president and chief operating officer. “In addition, we will be leveraging cross border reimbursement channels for the treatment of patients from other parts of the world based on our past experience with Strimvelis.”
