Fulgent Genetics to Provide COVID-19 Testing Solutions for the State of Utah. TEMPLE CITY, Calif., Sept. 15, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fulgent Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLGT) (“Fulgent Genetics” or the “company”), a technology company providing comprehensive testing solutions through its scalable technology platform, today announced a new partnership with the State of Utah for COVID-19 testing.



Through a competitive bidding process, the Utah Department of Health selected Fulgent Genetics to utilize the company’s FDA EUA-approved RT-PCR test for its “Test Utah” COVID-19 testing initiative. This initiative was developed to increase availability of COVID-19 testing solutions for residents across the state of Utah to help stem the spread of COVID-19. Fulgent’s RT-PCR test is being administered at a number of fixed sites and mobile units in select counties across the state, with the potential to expand as the program grows. Samples are collected on-site and processed at Fulgent’s lab in Temple City, California and results are delivered to patients within an average of 24 hours of sample receipt.

“We are pleased to be selected as a partner by the Utah Department of Health for their “Test Utah” initiative, which is making COVID-19 testing more readily available for residents of Utah,” commented Brandon Perthuis, Chief Commercial Officer of Fulgent Genetics. “The State of Utah joins the growing list of municipalities, healthcare providers and organizations that have selected Fulgent’s RT-PCR test for their COVID-19 testing needs. Our rapid turnaround time, reliable testing solutions combined with our user-friendly platforms and applications continue to be reasons why Fulgent is selected as a testing partner in these competitive situations.”

“As we look to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives across the state of Utah, we are pleased to be working with Fulgent Genetics as part of our “Test Utah” initiative to offer our residents a convenient and reliable testing solution for COVID-19,” said Utah Governor Gary Herbert. “The goal of our “Test Utah” initiative is to dramatically increase the rate of COVID-19 testing in the state so residents can have better access to testing and help stem the spread of COVID-19, so we can get back to normal as quickly as possible. We are thankful to have Fulgent as a partner to offer reliable and timely COVID-19 testing solutions.”
