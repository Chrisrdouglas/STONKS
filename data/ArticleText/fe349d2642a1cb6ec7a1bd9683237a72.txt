Bellerophon Provides Clinical Program Update and Reports Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results. WARREN, N.J., Nov. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLPH) (“Bellerophon” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on developing treatments for cardiopulmonary and infectious diseases, today provided a clinical program update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.



“Bellerophon continues to advance multiple development programs for its INOpulse® inhaled nitric oxide therapy,” said Fabian Tenenbaum, Chief Executive Officer of Bellerophon. “We are pleased with the rate of enrollment in our ongoing COViNOX Phase 3 clinical trial of INOpulse for the treatment of COVID-19. The results of a planned interim analysis are expected shortly, as the first 100 patients have now completed their 28-day assessment period. In support of our development and manufacturing plans in COVID-19, we have applied for government funding and are in discussions with a number of federal agencies, including Operation Warp Speed.”

“In our pivotal Phase 3 REBUILD trial for fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) patients at risk of associated pulmonary hypertension, we initiated the first clinical research sites, allowing us to begin patient enrollment,” continued Mr. Tenenbaum. “The Phase 3 trial builds upon our successful Phase 2 studies, and we look forward to presenting both our Phase 2 results and the design of our Phase 3 REBUILD trial this week at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Interstitial Lung Disease Mini Symposia and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF) Meeting.”

“Moreover, we continue to operate from a position of financial strength. Importantly, our current balance sheet provides us with the resources to progress our INOpulse development program through upcoming near-term catalysts and top-line results from the Phase 3 REBUILD trial,” concluded Mr. Tenenbaum.

Clinical Program Highlights:

COVID-19 (Coronavirus)

COViNOX Phase 3 Study: Bellerophon continues to enroll patients in the Company’s ongoing Phase 3 clinical study of INOpulse inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 and anticipates the availability of the results from a planned interim analysis shortly. The Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled COViNOX study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of the investigational INOpulse therapy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. The COViNOX protocol utilizes an adaptive design and aims to enroll up to 500 patients with COVID-19 who will be treated with either INOpulse or placebo at major U.S. hospitals. The primary endpoint will assess the proportion of subjects that had respiratory failure or mortality, which should allow the trial to serve as a registrational study for approval. In parallel, Bellerophon has applied for government funding and remains in ongoing discussions with multiple federal agencies to support the Company’s development and manufacturing plans in COVID-19.

fILD

REBUILD Phase 3 Study: Bellerophon successfully completed its End-of-Phase 2 meetings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and finalized its Phase 3 REBUILD registrational study of INOpulse for the treatment of fILD. The first research sites in the Phase 3 REBUILD study have been initiated, allowing the Company to begin recruiting patients into the trial. The REBUILD study will enroll 300 fILD patients who will be treated with either INOpulse or placebo. The primary endpoint is change in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). If approved, INOpulse would become the first therapy to treat a broad fILD population that includes patients at low-, intermediate- and high-risk of pulmonary hypertension.



Bellerophon reported positive top-line results from its Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (iNO-PF) of INOpulse for the treatment of fILD. Subjects treated with the higher dose of iNO45 chronically over four months demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in MVPA of 14 minutes per day, representing a 20% improvement (p=0.02). Improvements in MVPA were supported by benefits in other activity parameters, as well as two patient reported questionnaires, the University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire and the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire.



The results from Cohort 1 of the iNO-PF study were published in the August 2020 edition of the peer-reviewed CHEST journal. These results established the safety of the iNO30 dose and confirmed the potential for INOpulse to provide clinically meaningful benefits in levels of daily activity in this patient population.



The results from Cohort 2 of the iNO-PF study will be presented at the ATS Interstitial Lung Disease Mini Symposia. These results demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the iNO45 dose and established the dose and endpoints for the pivotal REBUILD Phase 3 study. In addition, Bellerophon will present its planned Phase 3 REBUILD study at the upcoming 2020 PFF Meeting.

Pulmonary Hypertension-Sarcoidosis (PH-Sarc)

Phase 2 Clinical Study: Bellerophon is continuing enrollment in a Phase 2 dose escalation study in PH-Sarc, and anticipates the availability of top-line data around the end of 2020. The safety and efficacy study is assessing the acute hemodynamic benefit of INOpulse via right heart catheterization. PH-Sarc is an unmet medical need with a median survival of approximately five years after diagnosis. Similar to PH-PF and PH-ILD, PH-Sarc cannot be treated with currently available systemic vasodilators.

Corporate Update:

In August 2020, Bellerophon strengthened its management team through the appointment of cardiopulmonary disease expert, Wassim Fares, M.D., MSCR, as Chief Medical Officer.

In September 2020, the Company presented at the Cantor Fitzgerald Virtual Global Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright 22nd Annual Global Investment Conference.
