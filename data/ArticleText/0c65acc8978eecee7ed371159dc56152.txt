Wave Life Sciences to Highlight Preclinical ADAR Editing Data and Neurology Programs at TIDES and OTS Annual Meetings. CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 15, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wave Life Sciences Ltd. (Nasdaq: WVE), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases, announced today that it will highlight its ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA)-mediated RNA editing technology (“ADAR editing”) and its neurology programs in Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) at upcoming conferences, including the TIDES: Oligonucleotide and Peptide Therapeutics 2020 meeting and the 16th Annual Meeting of the Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Society (OTS), taking place on September 15-18, 2020 and September 27-30, 2020, respectively.



At TIDES and OTS, Wave will share how it is developing ADAR editing as a potentially best-in-class RNA editing approach with applicability across multiple genetic diseases. Notably, one of Wave’s presentations at TIDES will include the company’s first ADAR editing data in ex vivo retina samples from non-human primates (NHPs). These data add to the growing body of in vitro and in vivo data the company has generated, which include editing in the liver of NHPs and the central nervous system in a humanized mouse model, in support of ADAR editing as an emerging platform capability at Wave.

Another presentation at TIDES will highlight Wave’s neurology pipeline, including its C9orf72 variant-selective silencing program for ALS and FTD, as well as its SNP3 program for HD, both of which are expected to initiate clinical development with the submission of clinical trial applications in the fourth quarter of 2020.
